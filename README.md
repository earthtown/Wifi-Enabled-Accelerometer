# Wifi-Enabled-Accelerometer
UNT ELET Senior Design Project

This repo is the collection of work done by Brandon Dunson and Chris Harris as their Senior Design project at The University of North Texas during the final year of the Electronics Engineering Degree plan.

The goal of this project is to develop a tool that can be used to measure the movement on or within a structure. The movement is measured by an accelerometer as a peripherial sensor attached to an Intel Edison x86 Atom CPU development module. The data is stored locally along with a timestamp before being uploaded to a webserver via the Edison's on-board wifi. The webserver serves a webpage that can be used to monitor the measurements locally or remotely.
