This folder contains all the software that will be used for this project. Currently the Eclipse IDE (windows) is what we will be working with. Eclipse can be found at https://software.intel.com/iot/downloads The Intel Edison also works with the Arduino IDE along with Intel's SDK that uses Javascript. However, we will be using pure C as our programming language.
