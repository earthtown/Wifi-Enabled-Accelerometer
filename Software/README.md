We are using the Raspberry Pi 2 model B and the NOOBS boot image. We installed Raspbian Jessie and updated everything as needed. We used prebuilt python scripts for the MPU6050 and DS1307 as a base and added our custom scripts on top of them. We also used CGI to allow user to input variables from the webUI.

This folder contains all the software that will be used for this project. Currently the Eclipse IDE (windows) is what we will be working with. Eclipse can be found at https://software.intel.com/iot/downloads The Intel Edison also works with the Arduino IDE along with Intel's SDK that uses Javascript. However, we will be using pure C as our programming language.
